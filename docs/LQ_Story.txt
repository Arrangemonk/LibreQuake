LIBREQUAKE BACKSTORY



    Ing-ing's version and additions
    -Libre is the name of the armed forces of the game. 80 years ago, they were the heroes of planet Spirit's war of independence from Scorn. The hero is Libre under codename Quake, nickname "butcher".
    -Libre Quake and his brothers in arms were set with the mission to recover the stuff lost to other time periods, Quake's new commanding officer heard of his reputation, and had his HUD specifically modified to keep count of the kills the Libre would make.
    -As Libres are not large in number, Quake has to work mostly alone, in a two-man team with Alma Droplet, a bit nervous and young scout, who goes runs ahead with rings of invisibility and partial intangibility, marking down enemy counts and secret caches for the butcher.
    -So essentially, Libres are heavy fighting units, capable of remarkable feats in the battlefield. Alma (spanish for spirit) are ghostly, able to pass though walls, but can't actually interract much with physical realm.

    If these teleporters take the player to alternate realities, why do those realities have mayan and greek architecture? Runic makes sense, since it's otherworldly. I guess it doesn't have to make sense.

aDaya's justification on why each episodes is just different time periods:

    The forces of Shoggoth have traveled through dimensions through time where in each of them they conquered Earth, with the game's Present being next when the game begins, starting with the human colonies (hence why we always start with a base map for each episode)

    Their goals being to completely conquer earth through space and time. They conquer the present last because they have built most of their forces in the past periods, and they need that to counter our technology, by sheer numbers
